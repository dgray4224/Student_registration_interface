This project is a student registration system that uses Tkinter on the frontend and SQLITE on the backend

This is my very first coding project done in spring of 2021. 
The goal was to create a student registration system that mocks one similar to one employed in a school system. I used Python's Tkinter package and connected
it to a SQLite database on the backend. Looking back on it, there is some stuff I wish I did better and may go back and improve on this at a later time. Nevertheless,
the program works just like a registration system. Users can add courses and delete courses and the host can manage the students records through SQLite. 

Ive included the code, the SQLite database, and a snippet of the interface to display the design. Hope you enjoy.
